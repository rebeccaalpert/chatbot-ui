# Composer AI Studio

Composer AI Studio is based off PatternFly Seed.

Patternfly Seed is an open source build scaffolding utility for web apps. The primary purpose of this project is to give developers a jump start when creating new projects that will use patternfly. A secondary purpose of this project is to serve as a reference for how to configure various aspects of an application that uses patternfly, webpack, react, typescript, etc.

Out of the box you'll get an app layout with chrome (header/sidebar), routing, build pipeline, test suite, and some code quality tools. Basically, all the essentials.

## Quick-start

Create a .env file with the following values (ask for the real URLs)

```
REACT_APP_ROUTER_URL=''
REACT_APP_INFO_URL=''
```

```bash
npm install && npm run start:dev
```

## Development scripts

```sh
# Install development/build dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run start:dev

# Run a production build (outputs to "dist" dir)
npm run build

# Run the test suite
npm run test

# Run the test suite with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run the linter
npm run lint

# Run the code formatter
npm run format

# Launch a tool to inspect the bundle size
npm run bundle-profile:analyze

# Start the express server (run a production build first)
npm run start
```

## Configurations

- [TypeScript Config](./tsconfig.json)
- [Webpack Config](./webpack.common.js)
- [Jest Config](./jest.config.js)
- [Editor Config](./.editorconfig)

## Raster image support

To use an image asset that's shipped with PatternFly core, you'll prefix the paths with "@assets". `@assets` is an alias for the PatternFly assets directory in node_modules.

For example:

```js
import imgSrc from '@assets/images/g_sizing.png';
<img src={imgSrc} alt="Some image" />;
```

You can use a similar technique to import assets from your local app, just prefix the paths with "@app". `@app` is an alias for the main src/app directory.

```js
import loader from '@app/assets/images/loader.gif';
<img src={loader} alt="Content loading" />;
```

## Vector image support

Inlining SVG in the app's markup is also possible.

```js
import logo from '@app/assets/images/logo.svg';
<span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: logo }} />;
```

You can also use SVG when applying background images with CSS. To do this, your SVG's must live under a `bgimages` directory (this directory name is configurable in [webpack.common.js](./webpack.common.js#L5)). This is necessary because you may need to use SVG's in several other context (inline images, fonts, icons, etc.) and so we need to be able to differentiate between these usages so the appropriate loader is invoked.

```css
body {
  background: url(./assets/bgimages/img_avatar.svg);
}
```

## Adding custom CSS

When importing CSS from a third-party package for the first time, you may encounter the error `Module parse failed: Unexpected token... You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file typ...`. You need to register the path to the stylesheet directory in [stylePaths.js](./stylePaths.js). We specify these explicitly for performance reasons to avoid webpack needing to crawl through the entire node_modules directory when parsing CSS modules.

## Code quality tools

- For accessibility compliance, we use [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe)
- To keep our bundle size in check, we use [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- To keep our code formatting in check, we use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- To keep our code logic and test coverage in check, we use [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- To ensure code styles remain consistent, we use [eslint](https://eslint.org/)

## Multi environment configuration

This project uses [dotenv-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack) for exposing environment variables to your code. Either export them at the system level like `export MY_ENV_VAR=http://dev.myendpoint.com && npm run start:dev` or simply drop a `.env` file in the root that contains your key-value pairs like below:

```sh
ENV_1=http://1.myendpoint.com
ENV_2=http://2.myendpoint.com
```

With that in place, you can use the values in your code like `console.log(process.env.ENV_1);`

# TODOs

Lets make the port that we run on configurable.

(Infra) Set the Registry Secrets at the org level

I will say (and we can sync about this if it does not make sense), we will need to be able to dynamically specify the backend's base url, since this is going to be a demo deployed on openshift where that URL will be auto generated.
My optimal case would be something where we could build an image that would read an Environment variable that has the backend url on startup and that way we could just deploy that image in different environments no problem. But it looks like that may not be possible, seems like that variable needs to be defined at build time.
